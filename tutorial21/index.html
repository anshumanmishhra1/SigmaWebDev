<!-- if talking about classes the color change will occur according
to last position that we are giving for example now we have all
css element that is class and last class is purple so it will
work accoring cpurple class and not written classes above, if 
red class is written in the last of stylesheet then the color
will be taken red inspite there are many classes in the h1 -->


<!-- Specificity: an algorithm that says which selector has higher 
priority: 

inline selector> id selector>class or attribute selector> element selector > universal selector -->


<!-- Origin: it means sometimes useragent writes some code defualtly
in browser -->
